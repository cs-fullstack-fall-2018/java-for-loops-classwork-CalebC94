Java Assignment on For Loops

### Counting to 100 using 'for' loop
# Given a main function:
```java
int lastNumber = 100;
System.out.println("Starting Count to " + lastNumber);
countTheNumbers(lastNumber);
```
Create a ```countTheNumbers``` method that will use a 'for' loop to print the count up to the limit passed in.

### List each name using 'for-each' loop
# Given a main function:       
```java
String[] names = {"Bob","Kenn","Kevin","Erin"};
ArrayList<String> studentList = new ArrayList<String>();
studentList.addAll(Arrays.asList(names));
```
Create a ```for/each``` loop that will use a 'for' loop to print the student list.
